Problem 1: Reverse a String
Write a function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
Example:

Input: "hello"

Output: "olleh"

Problem 2: Count Vowels in a String
Write a function that counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in a given string.
Example:

Input: "programming"

Output: 3

Problem 3: Check for Palindrome
Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
Example:

Input: "madam" -> Output: true

Input: "hello" -> Output: false

Problem 4: Find the Maximum Number
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number.
Example:

Input: [5, 1, 9, 3]

Output: 9

Problem 5: Remove Duplicates from an Array
Write a function that removes all duplicate numbers from an array.
Example:

Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Problem 6: Sum of All Numbers in an Array
Write a function that returns the sum of all numbers in an array.
Example:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: 10

Problem 7: Find Even Numbers in an Array
Write a function that returns all even numbers from a given array.
Example:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Output: [2, 4, 6]

Problem 8: Capitalize First Letter of Each Word
Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.
Example:

Input: "hello world"

Output: "Hello World"

Problem 9: Find the Factorial of a Number
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.
Example:

Input: 5

Output: 120

Problem 10: PingPong Challenge
Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 20.

For multiples of 3, print "Ping"

For multiples of 5, print "Pong"

For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "PingPong"

Otherwise, print the number itself.
